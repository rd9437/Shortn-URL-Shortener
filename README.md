- 🔗 Instantly shorten long URLs
- 📥 Redirect users to the original link when a short URL is visited
- 📈 Track total clicks per URL (logged-in users only)
- 📸 Generate a QR Code for every shortened link
- 📊 View per-link analytics via a personal dashboard

## 🧠 Why Use Shortn?

You **don’t need an account** to shorten links.

However, if you create one, you get:

- A private dashboard with your shortened links
- Click tracking stats
- QR code previews
- The ability to delete your account anytime
